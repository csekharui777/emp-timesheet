Reactive forms - ReactiveFormsModule
Template-driven forms - FormsModule(ngModel)


Template Driven Forms Features:
    Easy to use
    Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios
    Similar to AngularJS
    Two way data binding(using [(NgModel)] syntax)
    Minimal component code
    Automatic track of the form and its data(handled by Angular)
    Unit testing is another challenge

    easy to add,
    less scalable,
    basic form requirements


Reactive Forms Features:
    More flexible, but needs a lot of practice
    Handles any complex scenarios
    No data binding is done (immutable data model preferred by most developers)
    More component code and less HTML markup
    Reactive transformations can be made possible such as:
    Handling an event based on a debounce time
    Handling events when the components are distinct until changed
    Adding elements dynamically
    Easier unit testing

    reusable,
    more robust,
    testable,
    more scalable
